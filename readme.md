_run go programme:_

`go run <filename>`

_go structure_

```
package main
import ("fmt")

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World! This is my first Go program\n")
}
```

**_Data Types_**
_three basic types_
- Numeric types: integers,floating points, complex values.
    - int8 - 8 bit signed integers.

    - int16 - 16 bit signed integers.

    - int32 - 32 bit signed integers.

    - int64 - 64 bit signed integers.

    - uint8 - 8 bit unsigned integers.

    - uint16 - 16 bit unsigned integers.

    - uint32 - 32 bit unsigned integers.

    - uint64 - 64 bit unsigned integers.

    - float32 - 32 bit floating point numbers.

    - float64 - 64 bit floating point numbers.

    - complex64 â€“ has float32 real and imaginary parts.

    - complex128 - has float32 real and imaginary parts.

- String types: string concatenation, substring etc.
- Boolean types: 

**_Variables_**

`var <variable_name> <type>`

`var <variable_name> <type> = <value>`

`var <variable_name> = <value>`

_You can declare multiple variables with the syntax_

`var <variable_name1>, <variable_name2>  = <value1>, <value2>`
